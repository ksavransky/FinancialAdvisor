This application helps users select their investment portfolio strategy. The user selects a risk level they are comfortable with, and the application helps to show them how their portfolio will look. After selecting a risk level, and clicking continue, the user is prompted to enter the amount of money they want to invest. The amount selected is then allocated by investment category based on the risk level selected.  

Financial Advisor was developed using React/Redux, JS, jQuery, D3, and HTML/CSS.
